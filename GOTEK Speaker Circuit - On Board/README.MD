A design based on the schematic sketch on the Hardware Mods page of the FlashFloppy wiki.
This circut allows you to use header JB on a GOTEK Floppy Emulator as a speaker output to simulate the sounds of a floppy drive seeking.

This option uses a 4 pin header for the speaker connection to allow one to use a standard PC speaker.
